# What is Mimir?

Mimir is a service that allows you to easily query real-time data from the Nine Chronicles chain via GraphQL.
Since all data is stored in DocumentDB (MongoDB), fast queries through indexing are possible.

## How to use?

Odin: https://mimir.nine-chronicles.dev/odin/graphql/
Heimdall: https://mimir.nine-chronicles.dev/heimdall/graphql/

It can be used on both Planets, and you can use [Nitro](https://chillicream.com/docs/nitro/explore-the-ui) to create GraphQL queries in a UI.

## Structure

Mimir is composed of Mimir, which provides GraphQL, Mimir.Worker, which syncs data, and a database.
Mimir.Worker periodically fetches chain data and stores it in the database (MongoDB), while Mimir provides this data via GraphQL.

    MimirWorker -->|Stores Data| MongoDB
    MongoDB -->|Fetches Data| Mimir
```

## Check Sync Index

Mimir synchronizes Nine Chronicles chain data with Mimir's database using Pollers.
Due to this, there may be differences between the actual chain and the stored data, and you can check which index the data is stored up to through the metadata collection.

```graphql
query {
    metadata(collectionName: "avatar") {
        latestBlockIndex
    }
}
```
